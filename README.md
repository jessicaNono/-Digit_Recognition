# Digit_Recognition

A Python application that trains a neural network to recognize handwritten digits and then allows the user to draw a digit using a GUI. The application will predict the digit drawn by the user.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Develop a Python application that trains a neural network to recognize handwritten digits. It also allows the user to draw a digit using a GUI, and the application will predict the digit drawn by the user.
- **Technologies Used**: PyTorch for deep learning, Tkinter for the GUI.

## Project Structure

1. **Model Training Script**: A script to train the neural network on the MNIST dataset and save the trained model.
2. **Digit Recognition GUI Application**: A GUI application where the user can draw a digit, and the application uses the trained model to predict the digit.
