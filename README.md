# -Digit_Recognition
Python application that trains a neural network to recognize handwritten digits and then allows the user to draw a digit using a GUI. The application will predict the digit drawn by the user.

##Project Overview


    1- Objective: To develop a Python application that trains a neural network to recognize handwritten digits and then allows the user to draw a digit using a GUI. The application will predict the digit drawn by the user.
    2- Technologies Used: PyTorch for deep learning, Tkinter for the GUI.

	
##Project Structure

    1- Model Training Script: A script to train the neural network on the MNIST dataset and save the trained model.
    2- Digit Recognition GUI Application: A GUI application where the user can draw a digit, and the application uses the trained model to predict the digit.
